The grandson of the powerful Henry Cabot Lodge Sr., Lodge has served in the Senate as a firm liberal Republican, and as a Major in the Second Great War. Under General Devers, he witnessed the advance of the Sixth U.S. Army Group into Italy, and was awarded the Legion of Merit and the Bronze Star Medal for his exemplary service.<br><br>After his retirement from the military, he returned to the Senate in 1946, and led the effort to draft Army Chief of Staff Dwight D. Eisenhower for the Republican nomination, who accepted his overtures. However, following a convention deadlocked between the general and Robert A. Taft, a deal was hammered out in smoke-filled backrooms, leading to Lodge’s nomination for President on the fifteenth ballot, with William Knowland of California as his running mate. <br><br>As a liberal Republican, Lodge’s positions are generally to the left of the Republican mainstream. Despite his firm support of free enterprise, most conservatives harbor suspicion to Lodge due to his position as a leader of the “Eastern Establishment”, and for battling Robert A. Taft for the nomination. His courageous but somewhat ahead-of-the-times position on civil rights also may hinder his bid for the White House.<br><br>Somewhat opposed to the ascent conservative faction of the G.O.P., from which his running mate hails, Lodge will likely shift his stances to cater to the Republican coalition, without ruining his sterling reputation with moderates in the process. The candidacies of Humphrey and Russell may also complicate matters.</div>","color_hex":"#3232c8","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1091651292419604593/1115974948905820160/HenryCabotLodgeJr..jpg?width=630&height=750","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>Thanks for playing my demo!</h3><p>Please vote for me!!!</p>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Thanks for playing my demo!</h3><p>Please vote for me!!!</p>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>Thanks for playing my demo!</h3><p>Please vote for me!!!</p>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":false}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":116,"fields":{"first_name":"Hubert H.","last_name":"Humphrey","election":12,"party":"American Labor","state":"Minnesota","priority":1,"description":"","color_hex":"#b41e3c","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":0,"image_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1091651292419604593/1119295252033970196/HHH.jpg?width=630&height=750","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>DUMMY EXAMPLE RETURNS TO HELL</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":false}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":118,"fields":{"first_name":"Richard B.","last_name":"Russell","election":12,"party":"Democratic","state":"Georgia","priority":1,"description":"","color_hex":"#f08c28","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":0,"image_url":"","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>DUMMY EXAMPLE RETURNS TO HELL</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":false}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":121,"fields":{"first_name":"William","last_name":"Knowland","election":12,"party":"Republican","state":"California","priority":1,"description":"Hailing from California, William Knowland is a dynamic, conservative G.O.P. rising star.
