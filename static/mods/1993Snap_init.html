After the impeachment of President Stevens and the untimely fall of his administration, just two years ago, Pat, long judged to have been chosen simply for the purpose of appeasing the hardline elements of the Coalition, was thrust into the limelight, much to the dismay of even his own party. Through his policies, he has alienated and divided the country to the point that, in an attempt to prevent a total governmental collapse, a bipartisan deal was brokered to authorize once-in-a-lifetime snap elections. However, Pat faces stiff opposition not only from the tired Democratic-Farmer-Labor party and the rapidly surging Carnation List, but from inside his own party, with Campbell’s and Perot’s factions beginning to break away and ponder a separate run. Now, at this pivotal moment, will the Paleoconservative firebrand keep the Coalition strong? Will Biden channel the long-forgotten spirit of Henry Wallace? Will Kućinič spark a Carnation Revolution? Or somehow, against all odds, will the moderate Canadian become the first female president?","image_url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/849754649787629578/1131776490560823356/asm-usacarnation.png","winning_electoral_vote_number":270,"advisor_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Greensboro_skyline_from_the_Depot.jpg/1920px-Greensboro_skyline_from_the_Depot.jpg","recommended_reading":"my timeline, which will likely be coming out slowly in different forms throughout the foreseeable future","has_visits":1,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];e.temp_election_list = [{"id":15,"year":1993,"is_premium":0,"display_year":"1993Snap"}];e.credits = "u/Spacenerd4";e.global_parameter_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.global_parameter","pk":1,"fields":{"vote_variable":1.125,"max_swing":0.12,"start_point":0.94,"candidate_issue_weight":10,"running_mate_issue_weight":3,"issue_stance_1_max":-0.71,"issue_stance_2_max":-0.3,"issue_stance_3_max":-0.125,"issue_stance_4_max":0.125,"issue_stance_5_max":0.3,"issue_stance_6_max":0.71,"global_variance":0.01,"state_variance":0.005,"question_count":10,"default_map_color_hex":"#ebe7dd","no_state_map_color_hex":"#ebe7dd"}}];e.candidate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":152,"fields":{"first_name":"Pat","last_name":"Buchanan","election":15,"party":"National Coalition","state":"District of Columbia","priority":1,"description":"The incumbent, President Buchanan, has not had an untroubled time in office.
