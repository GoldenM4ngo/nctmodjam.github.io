Following the defeat of President Taft in 1916 and the Impeachment of President Thomas Marshall by a Republican-dominated Congress, which would lead to the aforementioned Socialist Revolution.</p><p>While Butler’s first two terms were relatively uneventful there were still signs of things to come, his aggressive treatment of striking workers and his increasingly corporatist and racialist policies worried some, but pleased many; such as the increasingly dominant KKK.</p><p>After his surprisingly easy reelection to a third term in 1928, things began to change. The Wall Street crash and the subsequent depression destabilized the country, and Butler’s relationship with the Republican Party began to sour as he became increasingly authoritarian.</p><p>The rise of the Teutonists was a shocking one; the emboldened KKK and the Wall Street Crash had left America vulnerable, and by 1932, President Butler had abandoned the Republican Party for the new Teutonic National Strength Party (TNSP), which was being heavily financed by Henry Ford. By 1936, most opposition had been crushed. When Floyd Olsen, a popular left-wing governor, tried to take on Butler, he was arrested and executed. His supporters formed the first organized resistance to Butler’s rule: The People’s Front for the Liberation of America (PFLA).</p><p>Despite Butler’s eagerness for peace, the other Teutonists pushed for alliances with the reborn Russian Empire and Japan. When Russia launched an invasion of Poland in 1939, the United States and Japan were drawn in, and so began the Second World War, with Britain, France, and Germany leading the Allies.</p><p>Butler increasingly became purely a figurehead, with his Vice-President Charles Lindbergh, Industrialist Henry Ford, Priest Charles Coughlin, and the eccentric leader of the Teutonist paramilitary, William Dudley Pelley, forming a ruling council. Butler died in 1945, and only a few months later, the cities of Richmond, Virginia, and Hiroshima, Japan, were destroyed by nuclear bombs. Russia had fallen into chaos, and the American Resistance now controlled swathes of the country.</p><p>Lindbergh surrendered to Allied forces in 1946, and he and the other leaders were tried and executed at the Evansville Trials. America was divided up by the allied nations, and various anti-Teutonist exiles were appointed as civilian leaders.</p><p>For the world it was peace at last.
