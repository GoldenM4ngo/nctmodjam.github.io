A pullout from Vietnam, higher taxes, federal aid- yada yada yada. He is a relatively young candidate, and his handsome apparatus could swoon some voters on that alone. However, his mayoral record is suspect, as New York City's crime and poverty rates continue to surge despite his leadership, and his recent switch to the Democratic Party has raised suspicions from party insiders, who wonder what a Lindsay Presidency would look like? Not that it's gonna happen, after all.",
